# Minimal Site Blocker

Minimal Site Blocker is a simple, privacy-focused website blocker.

## Privacy First

Unlike other website blocker extensions, Minimal Site Blocker does not track your browsing activity. We believe your data is your own. Standard blockers monitor the websites you visit to check them against your block list, often selling this data or using it for advertising. Minimal Site Blocker is designed to avoid this, offering a way to block sites without compromising your privacy.

## Features

*   **Intuitive Design:** No "how-to" screen is necessary.
*   **Open Source:** The code is available for anyone to review.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Available as an iOS and Mac app.

## Why I Made This

I created Minimal Site Blocker for myself because I wanted a way to block distracting websites without having my browsing activity tracked and sold. Now, you can use it too!
